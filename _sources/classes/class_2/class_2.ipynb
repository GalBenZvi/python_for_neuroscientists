Python libraries are updated regularly, and each released version may introduce new bug fixes and features, or remove functionality that was flagged as depracated. Code that was written using one version of some external package will not necessarily run successfully using a different version. Virtual environments allow us to create as many isolated environments as we'd like, each containing only the libraries we need, and in the exact versions that guarantee compatibility."

    "OOP is the most important programming paradigm nowadays, and you should be very familiar with it. Some problems fit this paradigm hand in glove, and the best example is GUI programming. However, it's not the \"ultimate\" answer to any design difficulty you have. Some problems _can_ be solved by using intricate objects and multiple inheritance, but in reality they're much simpler when solved using procedural design. Remember to write code that humans, and especially your future self, can read and understand.\n",
