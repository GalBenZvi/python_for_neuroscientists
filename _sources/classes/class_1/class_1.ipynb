Many packages rely on other packages, which in turn rely on other, more basic packages, finally leading to the basic Python interpreter. `pip` has to make sure to install all dependencies of the package you're currently after, and to avoid any collisions with other installed packages. For example, a common problem in the Python world is the Python 2-3 schism, which means that packages written for Python 2 can't run on a Python 3 interpreter, and vice versa. The package manger's job is to grant you the right version of the package you're looking for."

    "### Comparison with MATLAB's approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take a minute here to contrast Python's approach with that of MATLAB. In MATLAB, once we added a directory to the path using `pathtool`, each file in that file is now directly in the MATLAB namespace. This means that we don't have to `import` anything - adding something to `pathtool` is essentially `import`ing the entire folder into the general namespace, which is the only namespace in MATLAB world. This is a pretty straight-forward approach, but it's also one that no other programming language, especially a modern one, uses. This is because cluttering the one and only namespace is a bad idea, since you can quite easily overwrite names of functions from files with names of variables you use, and you won't even know it. Moreover, you don't need **all** functions around **all** the time. Each file and project will usually need a few different functions from a couple of toolboxes, and that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we have another layer between our code and the `import`-able functions. Inside our code we can only use built-in functions (`list()`, `int()`, `print()`, etc.) and functions that we explicitly imported, which will vary between files and project. In addition, we can only call `import` on files and packages which are in our Python's path. We'll discuss Python's equivilant of `pathtool` in the next class, but for now you should see the separation Python forces on us between the specific file's namespace and the general Python namespace (what packages can we even import)."
