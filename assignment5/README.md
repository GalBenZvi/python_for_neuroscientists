**Do not change the signature (definition) of the functions in the exercise.**

**Tests are run with `pytest`.**

1. _Data crunching:_
    The data available in `data.json` is a table of participants in a questionnaire-type experiment that was conducted. The data is mostly fine, but upon a closer inspection you may identify a few missing\corrupt values here and there. Define a class that have several methods that process the given data.

    ```python
    class QuestionnareAnalysis:
        """
        Reads and analyzes data generated by the questionnaire experiment.
        """
        def __init__(self, data_fname: pathlib.Path):
            # ...

        def read_data(self):
            """
            Reads the json data located in self.data_fname into memory, to
            the variable self.data.
            """
            # ...
    ```
    The following questions should be answered by writing methods that perform the needed computation.

    a. Plot the distribution of ages of the participants. The bins for the histogram should be [0, 10), [10, 20), [20, 30), ..., [90, 100).

        ```python
        def age_distrib(self):
            """
            Calculates and plots the age distribution of the participants.
            Returns a tuple containing two numpy arrays:
            The first item being the number of people in a given bin.
            The second item being the bin edges.
            """
        ```
