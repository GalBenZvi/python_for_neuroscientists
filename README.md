This repository contains material relevant to the entire course,
including the classes. You should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive
notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories,
but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub,
and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook. I've also uploaded them in a presentation-like `.html` format.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`,
please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.

## Hackathon

The year will end with Sagol Hacakthon. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GVy7XWHAtUcNIG7g9BTZLS7KH1_QesVWxn4VgnxyvzY/edit?usp=sharing) you can find the list of projects (currently 5-6 of them). Please write your name next to each project you wish to take part of. I'll have a session with each group in which we go over the details and refine each project to the scope of the availble 24 hours.

The hackathon will be conducted on the 27-28.6 in the "Miflat" near the main gate.
