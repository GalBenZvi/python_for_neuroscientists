This repository contains material relevant to the entire course,
including the classes. You should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive
notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories,
but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub,
and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook. I've also uploaded them in a presentation-like `.html` format.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`,
please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.

## Final Project

As I mentioned in class, we plan to end the course with a Sagol Hackathon, during which you'll write you final project - 60% of the total grade. The event will start with a lecture by a manager from the industry about Data Science and Python, and following that you'll divide into pre-determined groups of 3-4 students that will each tackle a project for a day-and-a-half. At the end you'll be required to present the work you've done in front of the class.

Project topics can be diverse - we're currently gathering a pool of these, and you're more than welcome to suggest your own ideas, taken from your lab's research interests. As mentioned, the scope of the project should fit a group of 3-4 students working throughout the hackathon.

The hackathon will be conducted on the 27-28.6 in the "Miflat" near the main gate. More details will follow.
