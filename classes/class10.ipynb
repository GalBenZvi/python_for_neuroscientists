We talked during class of how an `Age` type is an important example of defining our own types in a program, since it's neither an integer nor a floating point number.\n",

But it's actually more than that - it also defines the _interfaces_ between the classes, it forces the classes to have specific attributes that will comply to this protocol, linking their behavior together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two classes inherit from `Volunteer` and represent the first two steps in the \"Volunteer path\". The `loc` class variable signifies that. From phase one (`PreScanOne`( a volunteer can only advance forward (or drop out from the experiment) to step 2. And likewise from step 2 to 3 - you'll always find the same `.advance()` method that takes you to the next step, even though the implementation is slightly different. To handle the variability in the held data, we have the `metadata` attribute which can hold different parameters and datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part shows how to use such an interface. We have a function that advances an instance of a class \"one step\" to the next phase. We have a function that runs some processing on the data held inside the instances, and we can have as many functions (and classes as we wish). It's completely extensible since the API is well-defined."

    "Before we start exercising, one important note to remember: There's a thin line between under- and over-engineering. Very small scripting projects require almost no engineering at all. This might mean that after you gain a few extra months of experience in Python, the structure of code for a small scripting job in Python might be obvious for you right from the get-go. You'll know which data structures you'll have, whether or not you'll need a class or two, and how the user interface might go.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, large applications which span at least a few thousands lines of code will always need _some_ form of pre-planning. It would be senseless not to write out a diagram of the main modules in your code and their interfaces. One can consider this to be common knowledge, or a simple programmer's instinct. Just like architects sit down and plan for months in advance the construct what they're about to create, programmers should spell out the architecture of their own programs. In no way will this guarantee you'll get the architecture right in the first time, but the design might serve as good building blocks when you start the refactoring process."

    "Problems mostly occur when you write medium-sized scripts, up to a couple thousand lines. These scripts usually start out small - a few functions that deal with file I/O and display of data - but can grow quite quickly once you start adding functionality. When the script was short you probably didn't even write tests, since you were sure you're handling some insignificant piece of code, and now it starts biting back at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to write rules for these occasions. When someone asks me for improved functionality on some short script I wrote, I sometimes tell them it will take more time than I think it should, since I want to devote time to refactor the code, add tests and make the new functionality feel more natural inside it.\n",
