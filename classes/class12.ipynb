Today we'll try to dive a bit deeper and understand the \"how\" of git. This is because git is an immensely useful tool for our type of work, and it will be even more useful when we start hacking together in a few weeks time. "

    "In a version-controlled project we have these three basic components:\n",
    "1. Repository - the name for the entire collection of version-controlled files. We can have a local repository, i.e. one in our computer, a remote one, i.e. one on the cloud (like GitHub provides) or both. A repository contains both the standard files we're working on, and a compressed copy of them inside the `.git` folder.\n",
    "2. Working tree - the name given for the current state of the version-controlled folder, which might defer from the version that was previously captured and recorded. When the working tree is \"clean\" it means that there's no such difference between the latest \"snapshot\" of the codebase, as resides inside the `.git` folder, and the copy currently visible to the user.\n",
    "3. Index - an intermediate \"staging\" environment, the only place from which code can be inserted into the repository. This allows us to change many things, but only commit parts of them into the repository itself.\n",

The folder containing the `.git` folder is the \"top level\" of your repository, and will automatically notice any changes in the subfolders of that folder. It's usually not recommended to have several git projects inside a git-tracked folder. This means that if you have a \"my_code_projects\" folder which contains several other git-tracked folders, like HW assignments and other unrelated stuff, make sure that \"my_code_projects\" isn't a git folder in itself, i.e. you shouldn't have a `.git` folder in it. It's technically possible to have \"independent\" git repositories inside others (they're called sub-modules) but it's usually not the right way to organize your projects.\n",

When a file in a git-tracked folder has different contents from what the git repository has in it (remember that it has copies of everything) the file will be recognized by git as a \"changed\" file. In git terms, it means that the copy of the file in the \"working tree\" is different than what's in the repository. Of course, if we haven't committed anything, and only initialized the repository, __all__ files will have a different working copy than what git has in its repository, since git doesn't recognized any of them.
