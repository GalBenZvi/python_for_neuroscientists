# Introduction

Welcome to "Python for Neuroscience" course.
This course, unlike most, will be delivered via this [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

The "book" includes classes and other useful information.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in a different repository. As a student of the course, you should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive notifications when we update it with new material.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in [Resources.md](source/resources.md), please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found. *Feel free to ask us how to do so*

General questions - both technical and Python-related - can be posted to the "Issues" tab of the [book's corresponding Git repository](https://github.com/ZviBaratz/python_for_neuroscientists). We'll do our best to answer them as soon as possible.
