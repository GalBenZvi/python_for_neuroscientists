# Lessons and thoughts for next year

* Should JupyterLab receive a recommendation when reviewing IDEs? As of early 2020 it isn't a polished product yet, but they did just added a debugger, and it might be a whole lot better in early 2021.
* Every class that occurs after HW submission should start with a review of the submitted HW, even if a few students were allowed delayed submission. Reviewing the "correct" code is important, and seeing how good Python code looks like is eye-opening.
* Class 3 has a pretty thorough demo on environments, git and VSCode. Basically setting it all up from scratch.
* In the beginning of class 4, before or after HW review, I do another git + conda overview.
* OOP (Class 3): Many improvements were made in 2020, but these are perhaps not enough. For example, the start of class 4 is about inheritance, including an exercise. Perhaps mentioning inheritance is important, but I don't think that this exercise is necessary. Perhaps we should start the numpy part earlier.
* Seaborn should receive a larger emphasis when plotting. Bascially 99% of plots can be accomplished using seaborn with ease. If we start numpy earlier then seaborn can take more space, instead of the unneeded parts on OOP.
* Computational pipelines library? Dask? Luigi? Something simpler?
