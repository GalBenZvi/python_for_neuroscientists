# Lessons and thoughts for next year

* The IDE status is a mess - it's still hard to start coding in Python on your own computer, moreso on Windows.
    * Should JupyterLab receive a recommendation when reviewing IDEs? As of early 2020 it isn't a polished product yet, but they did just added a debugger, and it might be a whole lot better in early 2021.
    * On the flip side, PyCharm just upgraded their game, adding better git support and easier virtual environment integration. Students have free "Pro" accounts, which is also important.
    * Finally, VSCode also dramatically improved the "interactive" mode, which is alot like what the students are used to from their MATLAB days. Also, much of the course is already geared towards VSCode, in both examples, images and phrasing.

* Every class that occurs after HW submission should start with a review of the submitted HW, even if a few students were allowed delayed submission. Reviewing the "correct" code is important, and seeing how good Python code looks like is eye-opening.
* Currenlty I ask Windows-students to change their default terminal to the command prompt. Is there a better way? Maybe the git shell (bash)?

* Environments - the current situation in the Python ecosystem is crap. `conda` sucks, but it's currently the best option. As of early 2020, poetry seems promising but it still has issues. If these are resolved by next year then it perhaps should be the default for our students, it might be simpler to explain as well. If not, then perhaps `virtualenv` + `pyenv` (currently doesn't really work on windows, but it does on WSL. So if WSL becomes available in all windows machines it could work) is the best solution to teach the students. Not sure...
* Class 3 has a pretty thorough demo on environments, git and VSCode. Basically setting it all up from scratch. This is extremely important for the students. However - these aren't recorded\documented anywhere, since it's done "live" from VSCode. I need to record a screencast or use this year's Zoom recording. This tutorial should also include Python interactive.
* In the beginning of class 4, before or after HW review, I do another git + conda overview.
* OOP (Class 3 + 4): Many improvements were made in 2020, but these are perhaps not enough. For example, the start of class 4 is about inheritance, including an exercise. Perhaps mentioning inheritance is important, but I don't think that this exercise is necessary. Perhaps we should start the numpy part earlier.
* HW3 - FolderIterator question is a difficult nut to crack. It's "technical" in a way, but it also has some very important aspects to it. It forces people to debug their code, it makes them use Pathlib (somewhat) effectively, it teaches about properties of different collections (inserting new keys in dicts overrides existing ones, list(set(list())) destroys ordering) but it also keeps giving students the sense that everything they're doing is right, but the tests are wrong.
* I changed class 9 (testing) to talk more about testing in general and less about TDD. I feel like TDD is a major change which is very difficult to do in such a short period of time, and TDD is just a technique - writing tests is the issue here, not how you write them, or what do you write first. Class 9 also became very "interactive" in nature because of that, which is good I believe. In the hackathon students always report how significant testing was, so that's good motivation for this class.
* I added a new class with more libraries and more information about git, mainly for the hackathon. I did receive feedback that this class, as well as the one just like it (Class 10) are a bit too packed. It might be best to leave their text as is, but only focus on a few libraries.
* Python project structure - Updated HW4
